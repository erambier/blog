My master 1 endend with a [thesis](/files/ter.pdf). Along with my team mate In√©s, we choosed to dig into the European Option Pricing. The problem was challenging since both of us didn't have any kind of background in finance.    
 In a nut shell, in finance, an european option is a contract which gives the buyer (the owner or holder of the option) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified strike price on a specified date. The goal of this project was to clearly differentiate the pricing of the option and the portofolio management to cover a put lower that a call. We organized it in two parts:

The first part deals with the modeling of the problem. Before tackling the famous Black-Scholes formula, we first dissected a model based on the discret version of the stock market. The Cox-Ross-Rubinstein binomial option pricing model (CRR model) was first proposed in 1979 by financial economists/engineers John Carrington Cox, Stephen Ross and Mark Edward Rubinstein. Discritizing the problem helped us to fully understand the pricing and the portofolio strategies. We were then ready to simulate from real data of yahoo-finance a portfolio management with MatLab.  
The second part of the project aims to answer the estimation of the standard deviation.The so-called volatility is the only parameter of the Black-Scholes formula that couldn't be calculate from the past values. The volatility is also a famous and difficult  that jeoperdize the robustness of the Black-Scholes formula.
