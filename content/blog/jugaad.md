&nbsp; After my internship I was earger to learn new things. I wanted to arrive in a company before the whole workflow done, I wanted to participate to its implementation from scratch. When I met the founders of Jugaad, I liked the size of the company (it was the one founder + me) and the potential of predictive maintenance. One of the best feelings was completing tasks and projects on my own accord not because someone mandated me to. Also I could see my direct contribution to the overall goal and progress of the company. I felt responsabilities andn motivation. I also like starting to build a team by having an intern. After nearly a year with them, it is time to take stock. Here are the lessons I wasn't expecting to learn.


### We don't speak all the same language

&nbsp; With such a small structure, I was involved in all the steps of the selling. And every dataset starts with a sell. 
I rapidly figured out that none of the stakeholders was speaking the same language.  In the area of buzz words and data divas, it wasn't really easy to communicate clearly and with good accuracy with different stakeholders. The product of the company exists to provide a service to business and business is run by people. And if this people had spent too much time around business developers, it added a layer of incomprehention. There were two main struggle: firstly, a penible work of demystification of buzz words. After the talk with the business developer, client's expectations are through the roof even before I could open the dataset. 
And secondly if I couldn't make them understand the abilities in their data, there was no business. I wasn't ready for this gap between scientist and business. I wasn't expecting to spend that much time to understand, interpret and translate the conversations. 
Between audience and goals lies a lot of challenge.
Demystify buzz word


### Importance of Data Story telling

&nbsp; I could appreciate the atmosphere of a business meeting and how to present my results in the most efficient way for the company. This is not about showing off my skills or every step of the process. Now that I write it down, it seems so obvious. But the freshly graduate me was so use to defending my work in an academic context. It was refreshing to actually share on ideas and approaches rather than defending them. I appreciate the strategy to keep my audience interested and comfortable. I always tried to focus on outcomes and values rather than the cool stuff I did to obtain it.  I used to dislike data visualisation, but then I understood that it was my best tool of communication. I struggled a lot for choosing the right plot. I couldn't overwhelmed my audience with information, I had to make sure they understood the business value in many different way, and the data visualization turned out to be my best way of communication. I could have excellent results, if I didn't manage to communicate them there were useless. It is hard to tell how much of the process has to be present to build the trust in the results, but not too much to not lose the interest of the business. Outcomes and value make more sense to business people than process and complexity, but they need to believe in the results.


### Demystify buzz words

&nbsp; Every data set I worked with started with a sell. Being the first person after the selling guy was tricky. Client's expectations through the roof, and bad quality dataset are not going hand to hand. Plus people have super high expectation when we talk about data. They all think they are sitting on a gold mine whereas they have trouble to see the point. I felt pressure on this point.






When there was this kind f atmospher during meeting, it was way more easy to get verification of my results and honest feedback on the added value.

[//]: # (Exploring a dataset and finding the value out of it does require more than excellent statical skills. For instance I worked on a project with data from Waste Water Treatment Plant. The domain expert didn't know what he wanted out of his data. I knew nothing about Waste Water Treatment Plant. I had to wear a biochimist hat for a couple of weeks to understand the business value out of the data. Translation a dataset to a business value made this job so diverse. I love to investigate about it.ability to break down a problem put chatbot video wwtp clustering)
