After my intership I was earger to build a workflow and a team. from scratch

One of the best feelings was completing tasks and projects on my own accord not because someone mandated me to, but because as the only employee of the company, I felt like my contribution to the overall goal and progress of the company. I felt a huge responsability coming with having an intern. I wanted to give back what I was lucky to recieve during my own internship. 

ability to break down a problem
the communication skills required to talk to different stakeholders
