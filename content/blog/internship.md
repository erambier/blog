My internship was my first exposure to the real world within my field of study. I picked up a confirmed start-up (40 emplpoyees) with a bunch of data scientists and software engineers. I joined the coolest team within the company: the Data Science team. [NP6](https://www.np6.co.uk/) aims to help companies with their data activation. Clients such as Cdiscount (french amazon), Alinea (french IKEA) and BricoDépôt (big hardware store) trust NP6 to help them democratizing their data and thus, operate more efficiently through dashboarding and data storage. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; I was immediately included in all team meetings, and encouraged to share my opinions. I wasn’t expecting to feel so involved in the current workings and future plans. Laurent made sure that I dove into all the environment and vocabulary from the very early stage. Even though it was a bit scary, I was glade to be stimulated. 
 I was lucky enough to explore all kind of sight. In this article, I am going to go skim through them. For deeper understanding, [here](/files/rapport-de-stage.pdf) is my internship report.


Th first thing that hit me was all the steps needed to put a dashboard in production. 

## Significance of an advertising mail campaign

One of the company's product is to target some clients who would be interested in a certain advertissement. This particualr one was for a hardware store. They wanted to send mail about kitchen to a sample of their database, only to thoses who would be interesting into buying a new kitchen. 
My very first job was to implement a KPI for this campain. We wanted a rigorus way to assess the effet of the mail on the on the sales of the kitchen product. 
So, I compared the purchase amont of three population: people with a high score and who received the add, people with a high score who didn't receive the add and random people who received the add. 
I choosed the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. I embedded my implemention in the map-reduce in Java that was extracting the results of the campaign and processing other KPI. I didn't implement it from scratch but I modified the existing class of the package Apache Commons Math 3.4. 




## Churn model

After I got the grips on the team tools, I was ready for my first big project. I did a churn model. 

## Feature engineering of web data

Implementation of unitary test for adding new features into the models


## Prediction of missing values 

Thanks to the new open data policy in France, we have the possibility to get access to dataset with a lot of features about the population considering their living area. For example we can see that people living in a particular neighbourhood will be likely to have 2 kids, a car and a annual income of 60K. We wanted to add these informations into our featuring. For exemple in would be appropriate to send add for luxery product to wealthy neighbourhood. In the dataset, France was cut in 60000 area and 90 features were available. The only feature with a significant number of missing value was the annual income. Since it is a relevant one, I tried to predict the missing values from the other features. 


## Collaborative filtering

Cdiscount 

## A/B/n testing sampling size



## Getting my hands and feet dirty. All the way.

Coming straight from school, it's obvious that I discoverd many many news things. From data format to 
I was astounded by the mathematical elegance and rigor stored in the 
I was beyond lucky to be able to
I felt trust and supported, extract the best potential out of me
My internship was a true career revelation for me. I can't stress enough how it 
It was the revelation I was looking for. I was still not 100% sure if I wanted to spend the rest of my career behind a computer or sailing the world. 
I had the best supervisor I could hope to have, and Laurent if you are reading those lines, thank you.
